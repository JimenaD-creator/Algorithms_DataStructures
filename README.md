# Algorithms & Data Structures

This repository is a collection of implementations of algorithms and data structures in various programming languages. The goal is to provide a reference to review fundamental computer science concepts and how they work.

## Key Features

- **Clear and well-documented implementations**: Each algorithm and data structure is implemented with detailed explanations and comments in the code.
- **Multiple programming languages**: The algorithms and data structures are implemented in C++ language and the SFML library implementation.
- **Practical examples**: Includes usage examples for each algorithm and data structure.
- **Easy to understand**: The code is designed to be easy to read and understand, ideal for beginners and students.
